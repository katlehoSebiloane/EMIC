# Context
Due to the often unpredictable nature of P1 emergency cases, patient conditions can change rapidly. Paramedics need to prioritise patient care and as a result, critical patient  information gathered from the scene is often unavailable or incorrect by the time it reaches the appropriate physician. Although the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Patient Care Report (PCR) can be delivered electronically, the record is rarely complete and timely. This leaves physicians with an incomplete picture of the condition of the patient.

# Problem Statement
The most common cause of medical errors stems from communication problems and inadequate information flow. This is particularly true in time-sensitive and critical emergency cases; where both Advanced Life Support (ALS) and trauma unit teams need to be informed about the patient’s condition in real-time.

# Propsed Solution
Our Emergency Medical Information and Communication (EMIC) system transmits patient vitals in real-time to relevant emergency medical staff and stores them for reporting and reviewing services. 

Our focus area will be:
- Collection of patient vitals 
- Initial assessment checklist (general contextual awareness from the paramedic)
	-Include patient information (emergency type, sex, estimated age)
- Communicate patient vitals with doctors in the emergency room(ER) in real-time

# Benefits

    1. Accurate record of patient vitals for the duration of the emergency
    2. Gives physicians an informative and in-depth pre-notification of the patient’s condition
    3. Allow the ER to be more efficient in preparing for incoming patients
    4. Enables the paramedic to call on ALS for support with more detail on the patient’s condition (real-time patient vital data)
    5. Record-keeping of patient vitals for reporting and reviewing purposes
    6. Leverages existing technology and infrastructure
